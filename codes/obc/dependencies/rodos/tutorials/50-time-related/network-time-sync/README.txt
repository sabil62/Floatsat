Time Sync
ist a short example how to implement the Network Time Protocoll NTP.

to execute use ./executeit

please read 
    README-ntp-explanation.pdf

Each node displays its own time, so you can see after a few seconds after the start,
a client synchronises to the server. 

The easiest way to see that they all are synchronised is to take a screenshot.


To see a Time Triggered Protocoll implemented on this time sync

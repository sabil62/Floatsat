  _______________________________________________________________
Sorry but this time the doit is "doit your self"

all example programs generate a matlab  oder octave program.
to see the result you need to execute octave on the output

to see the original data (big noise) call
   octave measurements.m

Then try each filter
for example
    linux-executable example-filterrealdata.cpp
then execute it, write in a file
    tst > temp.m
WARNING: you have to stop it using ^C (control C)
See the results using
    octave temp.m

RODOS on Raspberry Pi - HowTo
=============================

Notes regarding the initial setup
---------------------------------

To run your RODOS image you need a MicroSD-Card with at least one partition on it. This partition **must** be formatted with the **FAT file system** and is usually the first partition on the card.
It must contain the [bootloader/GPU firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot).

You may also add 'enable_uart=1' to your config.txt

The best, you use a normal boot-SD-Card with Linux for Raspberry and modify the root partition.

How to run your image
---------------------

First you have to convert the ELF image (tst), generated by *rodos-executable.sh*, into binary format:

    $ arm-none-eabi-objcopy tst -O binary kernel7.img

Afterwards the binary file could be copied onto the boot partition of your Raspberry Pi's SD-Card.  
**IMPORTANT:** The name of this binary file 'kernel7.img' **must not be changed** and all other kernel images ('kernel.img', 'kernel7l.img', 'kernel8.img', ...) should be removed.

Definition of the whole interface to RODOS.
This is not only the user interface (API)
They are the same classes, methods, variables, etc
used to implement the RODOS core.

The best way to understand it is to see the examples
in tutorials.

If you want to see how to use a method,
"grep" (search) in tutorials the given name and see the example.

like generator01-simple.cpp
but instead of writing to stdout it generates two files:

mask-screen.h		with the definition to print the mask on the screen
mask.h			all macros (#define)


This is useful if your program consist of several source files which all
shall  include maks.h
else the other code would produce multiple definitions of 
const char* screen[] = { ..... }
